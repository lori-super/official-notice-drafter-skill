# Notice Style Guide

## Standard layout

1. Title
2. Recipients
3. Opening paragraph: basis + purpose + transition sentence
4. Main sections:
   - Section 1: arrangement/time scope
   - Section 2: requirements or submission instructions
   - Section 3: safeguards (optional)
5. Closing sentence
6. Signature
7. Date

## Tone requirements

- Formal, objective, executable
- No colloquial or emotional expressions
- Use normative command language (must, shall, strictly follow)
- Ensure time/scope/action are specific and checkable

## Reusable phrases

- "According to ... requirements, to ..., the related matters are notified as follows:"
- "Specific arrangements are as follows:"
- "Please complete ... before [date/time]."
- "Please attach high importance and implement strictly as required."
- "If there are issues, please report in time."

## Self-check before output

- Title reflects topic accurately
- Recipients line exists
- Each requirement has action + deadline
- No vague time words without quantification
- Signature and date are complete
